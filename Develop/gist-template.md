i will be describing the regex pattern for a users email address


## Summary
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/

 the provided regex is meant to match email addresses that follow a specific pattern, where the local part can contain lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, and hyphens, the domain name can contain lowercase letters, digits, dots, and hyphens, and the top-level domain should have a length of 2 to 5 lowercase letters or dots. However, it's essential to note that this regex might not cover all possible valid email address formats and might allow some invalid email addresses as well.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are special characters that don't match any characters themselves but assert a position in the input string
### Quantifiers
The OR operator, represented by | (pipe), allows you to specify alternatives in your regex pattern. It matches either the expression on its left or the expression on its right.

### OR Operator
The OR operator, represented by | (pipe), allows you to specify alternatives in your regex pattern. It matches either the expression on its left or the expression on its right.
### Character Classes
Character classes are sets of characters enclosed in square brackets [ ] and allow you to match any single character from that set.
### Flags
Character classes are sets of characters enclosed in square brackets [ ] and allow you to match any single character from that set.
### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are used for grouping parts of a regex pattern. They also create capturing groups, allowing you to extract and reference parts of the matched text.
### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, are sets of characters enclosed in square brackets [ ]. They match any single character from the set.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
By default, quantifiers are greedy, meaning they match as much text as possible. To make a quantifier lazy (matches as little as possible), you can add a ? after it. For example, .* is greedy, while .*? is lazy.
### Boundaries
Regex provides special characters to match specific boundaries in the input string. Common boundary symbols include:
### Back-references
Back-references allow you to refer to previously captured groups in the regex pattern. They are represented using \ followed by the group number or name.


### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind are zero-width assertions that check for patterns ahead or behind the current position without including them in the match. They are represented by (?=...) for look-ahead and (?<=...) for look-behind.
